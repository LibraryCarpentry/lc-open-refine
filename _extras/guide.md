# General notes on OpenRefine

## Common problems

* If learners are using a browser other than Firefox, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for them when they click the .exe file, have them point their browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ or http://localhost:3333 to launch the program.

* Mac users with the newest operating system will have to allow this to run by "allowing everything" to run. They can change the setting back after the exercise.

* Some students will run into issues with
  - unzipping
  - finding the .exe file once the software has been unzipped
  - finding the data file on their computers after downloading
  
* If OpenRefine crashes when launched from a network share drive, do the following:
  - Copy the OpenRefine folder to a local drive not mapped to a network share, e.g. "C:\Users\JaneDoe"
  - Open a Windows Command prompt
  - Change the working directory to the OpenRefine folder at "C:\Users\JaneDoe"
  - Run openrefine.exe

* If a learner is unable to install OpenRefine on their computer due to IT restrictions for example, there are cloud services available such as [https://my.datascientistworkbench.com/](https://my.datascientistworkbench.com/) and [http://refinepro.com/](http://refinepro.com/) that they could try.
