## Getting ready

You need to install OpenRefine and download a data file to follow this lesson.

### Installing and running OpenRefine

You can download OpenRefine from [http://openrefine.org/download.html](http://openrefine.org/download.html). This lesson has been tested with all versions of OpenRefine up to the latest tested version, 3.3.

If you are using an older version, it is recommended you upgrade to the latest tested version. 

There are versions for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Please follow the installation instructions on the OpenRefine wiki: [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions)

Notes:
* When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux from the address above, you are downloading a zip file. To install OpenRefine you unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a "local" drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.
* OpenRefine is a Java application, and you need to have a 'Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine. If you donâ€™t already have one installed then you can download and install from [http://java.com](http://java.com) by going to the site and clicking "Free Java Download".
* OpenRefine does not support Internet Explorer or Edge. Please use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) instead.

### Downloading the data

You can download [doaj-article-sample.csv](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-open-refine/raw/gh-pages/data/doaj-article-sample.csv), which is a csv file that will open in a new browser tab. Be sure to right click or control click in order to save the file (NOTE: In Safari, right click and select **download linked file**; in Chrome and Firefox, right click and select **save link as...**). Make a note of the location (i.e. the folder, your desktop) to which you save the file.
