- Suggest an improvement or correct an error by [raising an Issue](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-data-intro/issues).
- Run a workshop at your own institution! If you do, alert us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry): we're happy to help promote the workshop and offer guidance on running it. Remember, there is no better way to deepen your own knowledge of software skills than to teach others.
