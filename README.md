# Library Carpentry

The Library Carpentry module '[OpenRefine Lessons for Librarians](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-openrefine/)' is maintained by [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens), [Juliane Schneider](https://github.com/pitviper6), and [Carmi Cronje](https://github.com/ccronje).

## Background

Library Carpentry is a software skills training programme aimed at library and information professions. It builds on the work of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/).

These materials are based on the **Library Carpentry** materials initially developed and taught by [James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker), [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens) and [Daniel van Strien](https://github.com/davanstrien) in 2015.
[http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/). The original Library Carpentry contained four modules:

- Introduction, including jargon busting, data structures and regular expressions
- The Unix shell, including use of the command line and commands such as`grep` and `sed` to find data within files
- Git and version control
- Using OpenRefine for data clean up.

On 2-3 June 2016 during the [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events/global-sprint-2016) these existing four repositories were forked (links below) and re-developed within individual repositories, with the addition of a fifth module that introduces **SQL**, a topic which many librarians have expressed interest in learning.

- [library-data-intro](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-data-intro)
- [library-shell](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-shell)
- [library-git](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-git)
- [library-openrefine](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-openrefine)
- [library-sql](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-sql)

The Library Carpentry sprint was co-ordinated by [Belinda Weaver](https://github.com/weaverbel) and attracted global participation.
